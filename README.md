# Kleinanzeigen Viewer
Basic Kleinanzeigen.de App for Sailfish OS  
Search, a few filters and item view is working  
There are a few bugs and not all features of the website are working in this app, but this is only for my free time - don't expect too many updates  

**Roadmap**  
Bugfixing  
Save items as favourites  
Item categories in filter page  
Automatic next page loading
