Basic Kleinanzeigen.de App for Sailfish OS  
Search, a few filters and item view is working  
There are a few bugs and not all features of the website are working in this app, but this is only for my free time - don't expect too many updates  

**Roadmap**  
Bugfixing  
Zoom into images  
Offline error message  
Optimize RAM usage  
Save items as favourites  
Item categories in filter page  
Automatic next page loading

This app uses Kleinanzeigen Parser Â© by me

# Installing

You can find my app on <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/stoefelz/kleinanzeigende">Openrepos</a>.  
Download the rpm and install the app - when you have not enabled my openrepos repository you must install the seperate python-beautifulsoup package from <a href="https://github.com/stoefelz/python3-beautifulsoup4-sailfishos">here</a>.

The main goal of this project is to get a rough idea of how to create a Sailfish OS app.
